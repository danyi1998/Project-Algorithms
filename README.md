I coded this project after taking a class on Algorithms in my sophomore year of college. I wanted to practise using algorithms to solve problems. In this case, I used the breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest path from source to destination.

This program has 2 classes: Map and Control. Map is used to create flight maps that show all flights between cities. Control is a control class used to take care of this program's operations. Detailed documentation can be found in the source code.

The program will first print the cities and their corresponding indexes.

The user inputs the number of cities, x, to be displayed on the flight map and included in further operations. As creation of the flight map is not the focus of this project, for the sake of simplicity the program will auto-generate the map with the first x cities.

The flight map will then be printed. In the first row and column, consecutive indexes starting from 1 are used to represent each city. 

The user enters the departure and arrival cities. The shortest path from source to destination, and any stopover locations, will be displayed. 

All cities will be represented by their indexes for the sake of simplicity.
